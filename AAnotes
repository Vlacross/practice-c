Guide NOTES:
1- C is good starting language and is fast to compile and run.

2- C features :
    variety of datatypes
    fast & efficient
    portable
    easy to extend
    Modularity
    rich libraries

3- Parts of C program: {
    Pre-processor: "links header files; houses macros",
    Header-File: "Collection of builtin/ready-made functions; basic .h file is stdio.h",
    Function: " 'main()' function is body of each program; return type specified before declaration (ie: int main() {...; return 0})",
    Variables: "defined keywords used to handle values and behaviors",
    Statements-&-Expressions: "Statement are expression and more. They do things(ie: assingment); Expressions return something using defined computation",
    Comments: "single line comments started with '//' or multi-line comments surrounded with '/* ... */'"
}

4- Compile and Run C Program:
    run :
        cat > hello.c << EOF
            #include<stdio.h>
            int main()
            {
                printf("\nHello World!\n");
                exit 0;
            }
            EOF
    then run:
        gcc -o helloWorld hello.c
    
    Run program:
        ./helloWorld

5- C Language Basic Syntax Rules:
    How C-Language is specified/recognized is based on C "tokens"
        ie: the tokens of the line "printf("hello, World");"
        are: 'printf', '(', '"Hello, World"', ')', and ';' 

    Semicolon is used to mark the end of each line. If this is missing the compiler will throw an error.

    Comment symbols '//' & '/* */' are recognized by the compiler as text to not be compiled

    tips:
        c is case sensitive
        all c statements must end with a Semicolon
        whitespace is used to describe blanks and tabs
        whitespace is required between keywords and identifiers.

    Example structure:
        #include<stdio.h>
        int main()
        {
            printf("\nHello, you simple World.\n") ;
        }

6-  C Keywords:
        auto        double        int       struct
        break       else          long      Switch
        case        enum          register  typedef
        const       extern        return    union
        char        float         short     unsigned
        continue    for           signed    volatile
        default     goto          sizeof    void
        do          if            static    while

    C Identifiers - names given to constants/variables, functions, and user-data.
        -Can only have alphanumeric cshort hars and underscores (a-z)(A-Z)(_);
        -First char can only be a letter/alphebetic char;
        -Are case sensitive;
        -Cannot be a C Keyword;
        -Cannot conatin special chars;
    Example declaration:
        int customVar = "Some String";

    C Charsets:
        Letters(all alphebetic chars);
        Digits(0-9);
        Special chars(colon, semi-colon, period, underscore, ampersand, ...);
        White spaces

7-  Operators in C:
        -Arithmetic;
        -Relational;
        -Logical;
        -Bitwise;
        -Assignment;
        -Conditional;
        -Special;

        1) Arithmetic:
            [ +, -, *, /, %, ++, -- ];
        
        2) Relational:
            [ ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= ];
        3) Logical:
            [ &&, ||, ! ]
        4) Bitwise:
            [ &, |, ^, <<, >> ];

            Truth table for Bitwise &, |, and ^:
            a       b       a&b     a|b     a^b
            0       0       0       0       0
            0       1       0       1       1
            1       0       0       1       1
            1       1       1       1       0

            Shift Operator example:
                a =      0001000;
                b =      2;
                a << b = 0100000;
                a >> b = 0000010;

        5) Assignment:
            [ =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= ];

        6) Conditional:
            [ ? : ];        /*<-- intentionally no comma between symbols. */
            
            Example Ternary:
                (expression or booleanVariable) ? "this is what returns if expression is true" : "this is what returns if expression is false";

        7) Special:
            [ sizeof, &, * ];
            sizeofe     returns the size of a variable;         sizeof(x) returns size of variable "x";
            &           returns the address of a variable;      &x; returns the address of variable "x";
            *           pointer to variable;                    *x; will be a pointer to variable "x";
            
8-  Data types in C:
    https://www.studytonight.com/c/datatype-in-c.php
    https://userweb.cs.txstate.edu/~js236/201112/cs1428/lecture3.pdf

        Data types are broken down into two types:
            1)Primary data types: fundamental data types - int, float, char, and void
            2)Derived data types: Primary datatypes twisted or grouped -- array, structure, union, and pointer

                                    Primary Data Type
        Character                   Interger                    float               Void
            char                signed      unsigned                float

            Signed char         int         int                     double

            Unsigned char       short int   short int               long double

                                long int    long int
        

        Type                                size                            Range
        
        Integer
            int or signed int               2                               -32,768 - 32,767
            unsigned int                    2                               0 - 65535
            short int /unsigned short int   1                               -128 - 127
            unsigned short int              1                               0 - 255
            long int/signed long in         4                               -2,147,483,648 - 2,147,483,647
            unsigneed long int              4                               0 - 4,294,967,295
        Floating
            Floating                        4                               3.4E-38  -  3.4E+38
            double                          8                               1.7E-308  -  1.7E+308
            long double                     10                               3.4E-4932 - 1.1E+4932
        Character
            char or signed char             1                               -128 - 127
            unsigned char                   1                               0 - 255
        Void
            void - means no value. Used to specify functions that return nothing.

        (NOTE: 
            e/E is often used in place of scientific notation
            e- is the inverted (divide by 10 instead of multiply by 10)
                1.7E+3 is the same as 1.7 * 10^3 == 1700
                +3.4e38 == 34000...000 (with 37 zeros)
                -3.4e-38 == .34000...000 (with 37 zeros)
                +3.4e38 == .000...034 (with 37 zeros)
                -3.4e38 == -.000...034 (with 37 zeros)
            Mantissa - The part of a logarithm that follows the decimal point (any digits to the right of the decimal)
                If 0.12345678901234567 is stored in a type float (which can store about 7 digits in its mantissa), it will get rounded to 0.1234568
                A type double can store about 15 digits in the mantissa, so it would be rounded to 0.1234567890123456 

        )

9-  Variables in C Language
        https://www.studytonight.com/c/variables-in-c.php
        
        Variable - a named memory location
            -unlike constants, variables can change/can be changed during execution of a program.
        
        variables in C need to be given a type to define what datatype it will hold. This can be:
            char - Can hold a a Character
            int - holds an integer
            float - holds a float value
            double - holds a double value
            void

        variable names can:
            not start with a digit
            consist of alphebets, digits, and special symbols like underscore
            not include blank or white space
            not be a keywords
            use upper and lower cases of letters, but is case-sensitive

        declaration of variables must be done before they are used.
            it tells the compiler what the variable name is
            it specifies what type of data the variable will hold
            until the variable is defined, the compiler doesn't have to worry about allocating memory space to it
            declaration is more like informing the compiler that there exists a variable with the foloowing datatype which is used in this program
            a variable is declared using the 'extern' keyword, outside the `main()` function.
                extern int a;
                extern float b;
            
        Defining a variable means the compiler has to now assign a storage to the variable because it will be used in the program. 
            It is not necessary to declare a variable using the `extern` keyword if you want to use it in your program. 
            You can directly define a variable inside the `main()` function and use it.

            To define a var inside a function you must define the datatype and the variable name. You can define multiple vars of same datatype 
                in a single line by using a comma seperated list:
                    int a;
                    float b, c;
            
        Initializing a variable means to provide it with a value. Can be initialized and defined in a single statement:
            int a = 10;

        Identifyer - a name given to any function, variable, structure, pointer, or other entity in a programming language.
            can be a variable, but not all identifiers are

        Variable - a named memory location used in the program.

10- C Input and Output
    https://www.studytonight.com/c/c-input-output-function.php

    Basic input-output header file is stdio.h - contains printf() and scanf()

        Using %d, %f, %c, %s inside scanf() captures user input, followed by the &<variable> to initialize the variable to the input value:
            int num;
            scanf("%d", &num);

        printf() function returns the number of characters printed by it
        scanf() returns the number of characters read by it:
        
                int i = printf("studytonight");
            will return 12 as the result which will be stored in the variable i.


        gets() funciton reads a line from stdin() into the buffer pointed to by "str" pointer, until either a terminating 
            newline of EOF occurs.
        puts() function writes the string "str" and a trailing newline to stdout
        ```
            #include<stdio.h>
            {
                char str[100];
                printf("Enter a string");
                gets( str );
                puts( str );
                getch();
            }
        ```
        when compiled, the above will request a string and then print the value entered.

        Difference between scanf() and gets() is that scanf() stops reading characters when it encounters a space, but gets() reads 
        space as a character too.
            
11- Decision making in C ( if, switch, goto )
    https://www.studytonight.com/c/decision-making-in-c.php

    Decision making is about deciding the order of execution of statements based on conditions, or repeating a group of statements 
        until certain condiftions are met. In C, this is handled with:

    -if Statements
    -switch statements
    -conditional operators ? :
    -goto statement

    If statements:
        1) simple if statemtents
            if(expression)
            {
                statement inside;
            }
                statement outside;
        2) if...else statement
            if(exor)
            {
                statement block1;
            }
            else{
                statement block2;
            }
        3) Nested if....else
            if(expr1)
            {
                if(expr2)
                {
                    nested statement;
                }
                else
                {
                    nested else statement;
                }
            }
            else
            {
                un-nested statement;
            }
        4) using else if ladder
            if(expr1)
            {
                statement1;
            }
            else if(expr2)
            {
                statement 2;
            }
            else
            {
                default statement;
            }

    Notes - 
    -curly braces are not required if there is only one statement outside the if condition.
        example :
            int a = 5;
            if(a > 4)
                printf("yep!");
     -"==" must be used to compare as "=" assigns and comes back as true
     -other than 0, all other values return as true:
        if(27)
            print("hello")
        ^ prints true ^   

-12 Switch statement in C:
    https://www.studytonight.com/c/switch-statement-in-c.php
    
    Example syntax:
        switch(expression)
        {
            case value-1:
                block-1;
                break;
            case value-2:
                block-2;
                break;
            case value-3:
                block-3;
                break;
        }

    -The expression must be an integer value (either be an integer or an expression that evaluates to an integer)
    -Each case "label" must be unique ( i.e.: value-2 ) And end in a colon
    -line following the case statement can be any valid C statement.
    -if "break" is not specified, the block will continue to run through every case:
        int i = 1;
        switch(i)
        {
            case 1:
                printf("A");
            case 2:
                printf("B");
            case 3:
                printf("C");
                break;
        }

        ^This yields output: "A B C" since case 1 matches but there is no break until case 3

    -Nested switch cases are possible but not recommended due to their effect of increasing complexity of compiled

    NOTE: 'if' statements can evaluate 'float' conditions, whereas switch statements cannot.
           'if' statements can evaluate relational operators which are not allowed in switch statements.

-13 Looping
    https://www.studytonight.com/c/loops-in-c.php

    Loops are instruction sets that specify a condition, that if the value given to the condition is either true/false, 
        will either rerun until the given condition is met or break from the loop depending on what kind of loop / what the conditions are.

    Types of Loops:
        while
            While specified condition is true, continue loop and break once condition is unmet.
            Ex:
                #include<stdio.h>

                void main()
                {
                    int x;
                    x = 1;
                    while(x <= 10)
                    {
                        printf("%d\t", x);
                        x++;
                    }
                }
        for
            Used to iterate across a range (such as an array etc)
            Instructions(held within parens and seperated by semi-colons) state a starting value(what will be tested against the condition), ending
             value (what condition must be matched), anda step/increment/change (a mutation applied to the starting value before each testing 
             against the condition)
            Ex:
                #include<stdio.h>

                void main()
                {
                    int x;
                    for(x=1; x <= 10; x++)
                    {
                        printf("%d\t", x);
                    }
                }
            for loops can be nested inside each other. 
            Ex: (builds a "half pyramid")
                int i, j;

                for(i=1; i <= 5; i++)
                {
                    printf("\n);

                    for(j=i; j > 0; j--)
                    {
                        printf("%d", j);
                    }
                }
        do while
            Same as a while loop, but executes code-block before checking condition.
            Ex(general syntax):
                #include<stdio.h>

                void main()
                {
                    int a, j;
                    a = 5;
                    j = 1;

                    do
                    {
                        printf("%d\t", a*j);
                        j++;
                    }
                    while(j <= 32);
                }
        Jumping out of loops
            break - adding an inner condition with a break will immediately exit the loop once the inner condition is met

            continue - adding an inner condition with a continue immediately skips the rest of the code block and starts into the next interation.

- 14 Arrays in C
    https://www.studytonight.com/c/arrays-in-c.php

    arrays are structured data types - "Finite ordered collection of homogenous data" stored in contiguous memory locations.
        finite - data range must be defined
        ordered - data must be stored in a continuous memory address
        homogenous - data must be of similar data type
            Other structures in c are :
                structure
                lists
                queue
                trees
                etc

    Declaring an array:
        Syntax = <data-type> <variable-name>[size]

        example -- int arr[10];
        outputs: [0][1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]
            where each number in the index/location within the array

    Initialization of an Array:
        int marks[4]={ 67, 87, 55, 77 };

        float area[5]={ 23.4, 6.9, 5.5 };

        int marks[4]={ 44, 55, 22 ,33, 7 }  // This creates a compile time error as it is adding more items than memory is allocated

            #include<stdio.h>

            void main()
            {
                int i;
                int arr[]= { 2, 3, 4 };
                for(i=0; i < 3; i++)
                {
                    printf("%d", arr[i]);
                }
            }

        Initializing arrays at runtime using scanf can be used for large arrays or when using user specified values:

            #include<stdio.h>

            void main()
            {
                int arr[4];
                int i, j;
                printf("Enter Array element");
                for(i=0; i < 4; i++)
                {
                    scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
                }
                for(j=0; j < 4; j++)
                {
                    printf("%d\n", arr[j]);
                }
            }

        Two Dimensional Arrays:
            Sytnax = <data-type> <arr-name> [row-size][column-size]

            int a[3][4]:
                    [0[0]]    [0][1]      [0][2]
                    [1[0]]    [1][1]      [1][2]
                    [2[0]]    [2][1]      [2][2]

        Or as -
            int arr[][3] = {
                { 0, 1, 2 },
                { 3, 2, 1 }
            };
            **Without speficying any row-number(the empty square-bracket) it means we can initialize any number of rows, but they must
                follow the size specified for columns if it is set.
                
            #include<stdio.h>

            void main()
            {
                in arr[3][4];
                int i, j;
                printf("Enter array element");
                for(i=0; i < 3; i++)
                {
                    for(j=0; j < 4; j++)
                    {
                        scanf("%d", &arr[i][j]);
                    }
                }
                for(i = 0; i < 4; i++)
                {
                    for(j=0; j < 4; j++)
                    {
                        printf("%d", arr[i][j]);
                    }
                }
            }
